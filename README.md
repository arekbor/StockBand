# StockBand

This is my first asp.net model view controller project, created for my indie rock band. 
The band members can upload tracks demo with description and lyrics.

## Band member profiles

Band members can change avatar and header picture. 

## Albums

Band members can create album to organize own demo tracks

## Audio visibility 

App allows band members with owner role to modify track visibility as:

- Private
- Internal
- Public

These visibility levels affect who can see the track demo.
